A very simple product that shows some good practices that I apply everyday as a Software Engineer.

## Highlights

- Flutter adaptation of [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164) by [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) 
- Firebase as a Backend Service using Firestore and Storage services
- Strong reactive programming
- Eithers, Monads and many other FP thingies
- [Bloc/Cubit](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) as a state management solution.
- Dependency Injection using [injectable](https://pub.dev/packages/injectable) and [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) packages
- Feature oriented architecture, decoupling as much as possible the entire dependency tree.

## Running Tests ðŸ§ª

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```
